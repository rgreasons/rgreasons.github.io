I started writing this post on Thursday as I was nearing what I thought was the release date and time of Kanye West's seventh album. I had been concerned for a few weeks that all of the press surrounding the album indicated it was going to be unfinished, or uncharacteristically imperfect.  Even though I still have yet to listen to the album, the way in which the rollout actually manifested between Thursday and today has me even more concered than I was last week.

Paying attention to the album creation and release process has always intrigued me, both as a fan and a musician.  Kanye's albums have always been especially interesting because of where he sits in pop culture: a huge celebrity, a musical innovator, an uncompormising control freak. Posh recording sessions in Hawaii with every imaginable pop star, biometrically sealed briefcases of master tapes, and 11th hour vocal tracks have become part of the mythology of his recent albums.

The rollout for his most recent album, 2013's *Yeezus*, was highly irregular for its time - radio silence until he went into an all-out media blitz in the month leading up to the album's release.  It was disconcerting to hear he was still putting the finishing touches on the album as he was releasing the lead single and shipping out the master files. It was annoying that he took big, scary stand against the music industry by refusing to allow pre-orders of the album.  But after stunts like Beyonce and Drake's digital-only out-of-nowhere releases, the *Yeezus* release just feels like a product of trying to strike a balance between creative control and fitting into the industry landscape.

I initially thought *The Life of Pablo* was going to be cut from a similar cloth, but Kanye has thrown the industry to the wind- and with it, pretty much any respect for the album as a product and finished piece of work.

As much as I loved Ye's transparency leading up to *TLOP*'s release, I was worried.  Multiple publicized tracklist changes and name changes suggested we'd be getting another last-minute release, cemented by the lack any mention of a physical release. 

The album was officially "launched" with a Madison Square Garden event to celebrate the debut of his most recent season of his Adidas clothing line.  I withheld judgement on music I only listened to as a 240p livestream, but had to once again check my expectations of ever hearing it at a reasonable bitrate when he tweeted another tracklist change and some additional recording after the event ended.

By the time he *actually* released the album some 48 hours later following an SNL performance, I was ready to get off of the emotional rollercoaster. I was no longer excited for one of my most anticipated albums of the year because the artist refused to step back for 48 hours and let his album be an album. I've heard critics remark how it's exciting to know that this album is a picture of an artist *right now* - not last week or a few months ago, but about 15-20 minutes ago.  That's fine if he's ready to step away and let the art stand for itself, but we're talking about a guy who [is still talking about changing the final product after he's released it](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/698971890581401600).

Even though this is really just one long complaint about my inability to get my grubby mitts on a compact disc of a music release, I think it's germane to Kanye as a historic artist. Kanye does not try to hide his concern for his legacy and contributions to society, so is it not fair to take a 100-mile view of how he's probably thinking about all of this? I think the series of stunts leading up to *The Life of Pablo* went beyond some crazy rogue marketing and pushing the limits of the music industry and into actively undermining his art. Kanye should take a page from his heroes and from his own past: if an idea is really going to turn the world on its head, the world will wait the extra 48 hours to get the best version of it.
