title: The Blog Lives!
---
So after a lot of tinkering, I finally have a blog.
<!--excerpt-->

It took a couple weeks of upheaval to finally land on a hosting platform.  Initially my static page was hosted on DigitalOcean using node, express, and nginx.  My plan was to write my blog infrastucture from the ground up, maybe node/koa/mongo or angular.  The windows I have to develop after work aren't as big as I'd like, so I wanted to go wth a more out-of-the-box solution. [Ghost](https://ghost.org) was the plan, but it wasn't going to play nice with the rest of the site.  So I gave [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com]) a try.

I wasn't keen on the idea at first because I wanted to use some sort of database, but after some poking around I realized it was going to be a great fit with the scattershot projects and blog posts I'd like to roll out. As a bonus, I'll save some money each year on hosting.

Right now I'm happy to have posts live-ish; pagination and tagging are next on the to-do list.
