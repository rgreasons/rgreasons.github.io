    <h1>Richard Reasons</h1>
    <h2>Data-driven Developer</h2>

    I love to solve challenges and answer questions with datasets of all shapes and sizes. I am currently the Staff Data Engineer at <a href="https://www.hologram.io">Hologram</a>, doing anything and everything data-related to power our platform to enable other innovators to deploy IoT devices at scale. Previously I spent almost a decade at Humana in a variety of data-related roles to help power a Fortune 100 healthcare company.<br>
    <br>
    I started as web developer and my passion for data visualztion led me further and further down data-related rabbit holes. I have had a lot of titles in my relatively short career- business consultant, analytics engineer, data scientist, data engineer- but in all of them I was happiest when writing code to bring data products to life. I like to use battle-tested tools and products and would would prefer to write Python and SQL than to chase today's trendiest language.<br>

    I'm originally from northwest Indiana and graduated from Purdue University's Computer Information Technology program with a concentration in Information Systems. Interning for Humana while in school made me realize that few things make me as excited as exposing people to new ways of consuming data (and discovering new bits of knowledge myself). In 2021 I completed my Master's in Analytics from Georgia Tech.<br>

    When not behind a keyboard, I'm usually spending time with my wife and our two dogs. I also enjoy playing music, collecting CDs & records, reading, and watching Survivor.
