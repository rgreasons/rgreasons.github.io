    I'm a developer currently based out of Louisville, Kentucky who loves to deliver data-driven projects and deliver new insights. I'm currently an applications engineer with Humana in its information management and analytics division.<br>
    <br>
    I've cut my teeth on the .NET stack and C# has been my bread and butter for the past 3 years. A growing portion of my job has been QlikView development to provide data visualizations on top of Humana's large datasets.  I've tinkered with other languages in the past, such as Java and Javascript/node.js, and I'll be tackling some visualization and analysis projects in Pyhton for this site.<br>
    <br>
    I'm originally from northwest Indiana and graduated from Purdue University's Computer Information Technology program with a concentration in Information Systems. Interning for Humana while in school made me realize that few things make me as excited as exposing people to new ways of consuming data (and discovering new bits of knowledge myself).<br>
    <br>
    When not behind a keyboard, I'm usually spending time with my girlfriend Sara and our pug, Lola. I'm an independent music fan, NBA enthusiast, CD collector, and fiction reader.
