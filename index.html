    I'm currently based out of Chicago and have spent my career dealing with all things data. I currently work at The Aspen Group as a Principal Data Platform Engineer, helping improve the data infrastructure that powers over 1100 dental facilities across the US.<br>
    <br>
    I started as web developer and my passion for data visualztion led me further and further down data-related rabbit holes. I have had a lot of titles in my relatively short career- business consultant, analytics engineer, data scientist, data engineer- but in all of them I was happiest when writing code to bring data products to life. I like to use battle-tested tools and products and would would prefer to write Python and SQL than to chase today's trendiest language.<br>

    I'm originally from northwest Indiana and graduated from Purdue University's Computer Information Technology program with a concentration in Information Systems. Interning for Humana while in school made me realize that few things make me as excited as exposing people to new ways of consuming data (and discovering new bits of knowledge myself). In 2021 I completed my Master's in Analytics from Georgia Tech.<br>

    When not behind a keyboard, I'm usually spending time with my wife and our two dogs. I also enjoy playing music, collecting CDs & records, reading, and watching Survivor.
