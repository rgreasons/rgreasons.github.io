    I'm a software developer and data nerd currently based out of Louisville, Kentucky who loves to deliver data-driven projects and deliver insights. I'm currently a data scientist with Humana working on improving developer productivity and how Humana approaches the software development lifecycle.<br>
    <br>
    I cut my teeth as a web developer and my passion for data visualztion led me to developing reports and dashboards in leading BI Tools to drive business initiatives using Humana's large datasets. I write a lot of R and Scala at my day and come home to write Python to keep my skills sharp, from web development to advanced analysis.<br>
    <br>
    I'm originally from northwest Indiana and graduated from Purdue University's Computer Information Technology program with a concentration in Information Systems. Interning for Humana while in school made me realize that few things make me as excited as exposing people to new ways of consuming data (and discovering new bits of knowledge myself).<br>

    When not behind a keyboard, I'm usually spending time with my fianc√© and our two dogs. I'm an independent music fan, NBA enthusiast, CD collector, and fiction reader.
