    I'm a developer currently based out of Louisville, Kentucky who loves to deliver data-driven projects and deliver insights. I'm currently a business consultant with Humana working on improving our relationships with our providers.<br>
    <br>
    I cut my teeth as a web developer and my passion for data visualztion led me to developing reports and dashboards in leading BI Tools to drive business initiatives using Humana's large datasets. Most recently I've been using Python as my swiss army knife for all of my development needs, from web development to advanced analysis.<br>
    <br>
    I'm originally from northwest Indiana and graduated from Purdue University's Computer Information Technology program with a concentration in Information Systems. Interning for Humana while in school made me realize that few things make me as excited as exposing people to new ways of consuming data (and discovering new bits of knowledge myself).<br>
    <br>
    When not behind a keyboard, I'm usually spending time with my girlfriend Sara and our pug, Lola. I'm an independent music fan, NBA enthusiast, CD collector, and fiction reader.
