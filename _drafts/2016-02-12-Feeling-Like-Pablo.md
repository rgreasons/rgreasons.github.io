title: Feeling Like Pablo: How Kanye's Album Rollout is Making Me Blue

As a fan of both creating and consuming music, I love getting a behind-the-scenes look at artists' creative processes.  making-of documentaries, oral histories, musical gear discussions, pictures from the studio - I eat it all up.  Following the developments of Kanye West albums has been no exception. 
<!--excerpt-->
After his third album *Graduation* sold nearly a million copies of his third album its first week, Kanye's profile grew so great that music journalists begin tracking his every move.  Stories of Rick Ross and Rihanna and the dude from Bon Iver just hiding out in Hawaii with Ye recording upped the stakes of his next album.  He lived up to the expectations when he started releasing tracks as part of his "Good Fridays" series, giving fans B-sides and early mixes of album cuts. The wave of hype hit me hard and I was totally hooked by the time *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* was finally released.

He followed it up with a collaboration with Jay-Z, *Watch the Throne*, that was notable for being an industry oddity: it didn't leak.  Fans were given singles, but the record label took outstanding measures at the CD pressing plants (extra security for workers, last-minute pressings, biometrically-sealed suitcases of the master tapes) to make sure details didn't leak out.  It was fun to actually be kept on my toes for new information.

The press scrutiny was present once again in the time leading up to his 2013 album *Yeezus.* We knew he was in Paris.  We knew there was a revolving door of producers. He lifted his self-imposed press embargo in May to project the first single onto buildings around the country - all the while still putting finishing touches on at the 11th hour and 58th minute.  All of the reports from his circle suggested the same thing: it's been gestating for a long time and he kicked it into high gear for a few months to get it out the door.

As thrilling as it was to have a torrent of information about Kanye's angry new protest record, it was confusing that he protested against *everything.* His anti-consumerist stance made it difficult for consumers to throw their money at him - The album wasn't available for pre-order. 

Although I still stand by stance that it's a decent album, I can't help but shake the feeling that Kanye's 0-to-100 attitude made it a rush job. All signs point to his newest record, *The Life of Pablo,* being cut from a similar cloth.

The lead up to *TLOP* has been very similar to that of *Yeezus*. We've known he's been working and that an early 2016 release was expected, following album name declarations and one-off single "All Day."  In late January he went on his typical press blaze, releasing track "Real Friends," delcaring and February release, and changing the album's name for the third (or fourth?) time. The release went further off the hinges as the release date neared.

Whereas with *Yeezus* the public had suspicions of the noise behind the scenes, this time around Kanye pulled back the curtain and let the public see him warp his plans at the last minute.  He gave a release date of February 11th and shared lots of evidence he was still in the studio - even tweeting about still working on the album art a day before the album's release.  At the livestreamed release event, he just played the tracks off of his laptop and tweeted after the show he was just now going to get the album mastered.  He announced *another* new tracklist after the time fans expected to have the album in their hands.

As much as I expected to love the transparency, I was just worried. Say what you will about geniuses working in mysterious ways or against a deadline or something, but Kanye seemed to be bragging about a total lack of checks and balances. He has a history of being a meticulous perfectionist and suddenly seemed to be pushing his craft out the door days or hours after finishing it. I would be less skeptical if he wasn't billing this as an album - fellow Chicago-based megalomaniac Billy Corgan embraced the volatility of the music industry by releasing new Smashing Pumpkins music as non-traditional "song cycles." But Ye is billing this as a traditional record while going out of his way to make sure he puts the same amount of care into its release as any of his other records.

I'm not denying the last-minute changes and procrastination haven't always been an issue; they became a positive part of the mythology of *Yeezus*. But unlike with his previous releases, he got out in front of the world and said "here it is, my finished product," only to keep tinkering.  There were CDs to press and iTunes promotions to launch.  Even if some old-school album launch machinations are unnecessary, we're talking about a guy who [is still talking about changing the final product after he's released it](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/698971890581401600).

As Jayson Greene noted in his [review of the album for Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21542-the-life-of-pablo/), Kanye's 'devotion to the craft of album-making remains his greatest talent." As much as I've refused to acknowledge the "albums as an artform are dying" arguments, it's disconcerting to watch one of the format's best contributors seem to put less and less stock into the idea of an album as a singular piece of work.  Despite how good or bad the album is, I'll always be asking "what if" after knowing all of the details and watching Kanye treat his "album of a life" like I treat road trip playlist. Maybe it turns out I'm old-fashioned and artists will come up with new technology to keep modifying versions of their songs like I modify versions of my code.  I just hope in the future it feels like a mindful strategy and not a overwrought mistake.
