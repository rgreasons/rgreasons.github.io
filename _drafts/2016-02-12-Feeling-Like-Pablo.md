As a fan of both creating and consuming music, I love getting a behind-the-scenes look at artists' creative processes.  making-of documentaries, oral histories, musical gear discussions, pictures from the studio - I eat it all up.  Following the developments of Kanye West albums has been no exception. 
<!--excerpt-->
After his third album *Graduation* sold nearly a million copies of his third album its first week, Kanye's profile grew so great that music journalists begin tracking his every move.  Stories of Rick Ross and Rihanna and the dude from Bon Iver just hiding out in Hawaii with Ye recording upped the stakes of his next album.  He lived up to the expectations when he started releasing tracks as part of his "Good Fridays" series, giving fans B-sides and early mixes of album cuts. The wave of hype hit me hard and I was totally hooked by the time *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* was finally released.

He followed it up with a collaboration with Jay-Z, *Watch the Throne*, that was notable for being an industry oddity: it didn't leak.  Fans were given singles, but the record label took outstanding measures at the CD pressing plants (extra security for workers, last-minute pressings) to make sure details didn't leak out.  It was fun to actually be kept on my toes for new information.

The press scrutiny was present once again in the time leading up to his 2013 album *Yeezus.* We knew he was in Paris.  We knew there was a revolving door of producers. He lifted his self-imposed press embargo in May to project the first single onto buildings around the country - all the while still putting finishing touches on at the 11th hour and 58th minute.  All of the reports from his circle suggested the same thing: it's been gestating for a long time and he kicked it into high gear for a few months to get it out the door.

As thrilling as it was to have a torrent of information about Kanye's angry new protest record, it was confusing that he protested against *everything.* His anti-consumerist stance made it difficult for consumers to throw their money at him - The album wasn't available for pre-order. 

Although I still stand by stance that it's a decent album, I can't help but shake the feeling that Kanye's 0-to-100 attitude made it a rush job. All signs point to his newest record, *The Life of Pablo,* being cut from a similar cloth.


Right now I'm happy to have posts live-ish; pagination and tagging are next on the to-do list.
